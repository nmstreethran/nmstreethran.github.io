I would like to share a couple of Spotify playlists I have made! 

The first is [Jeremy Soule - TES](https://open.spotify.com/user/11180709296/playlist/595ODoohu5H1ZYhaGmFZBj?si=ij3xAZJTSv2G9BUGX-tsyA), which contains all of my favourite soundtracks from [The Elder Scrolls](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en) III, IV and V, composed by the one and only [Jeremy Soule](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJeremySoule/). I listen to these tracks while working, so you will not find any combat music or distracting tunes in this playlist.

The second playlist is [Climate Change](https://open.spotify.com/user/11180709296/playlist/1FUq8L9C7PgtBI6ELlY5Ry?si=it6ou617Qr-JSQHvFQGmnQ). I started this off by adding songs that were in The Guardian's [readers recommended playlist on songs about climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/28/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-climate-change). I then added a few other tracks which I feel send some message about anthropogenic warming of the Earth. If you have any suggestions to add to this playlist, please tweet me [@nmstreethran](https://twitter.com/nmstreethran)! And let us all do our part to help mitigate climate change.
