I came across my undergraduate honours project while going through my files. My project was on paper-based microfluidic devices for point-of-care disease diagnostics, and I submitted it in April 2016. I then went on to specialise in renewable energy, and did not work on this project further. I thought I should release the files under open-source licenses. Who knows, they might be of interest to someone in the domain of medical devices. At the same time, I can use them to complete this module and learn a thing or two about versioning and indexing projects with Zenodo.

The files can be found in its GitHub repository, and the final updated version is published on Zenodo.

The repository contains [computer-aided design (CAD) files and engineering drawings](https://github.com/nmstreethran/paper-based-microfluidics/blob/master/CAD_files) of four different design concepts of paper-based microfluidic devices, in addition to the [final report](https://github.com/nmstreethran/paper-based-microfluidics/blob/master/final_report.pdf).

I submitted this repository and Zenodo archive to complete [Module 5: Open Research Software and Open Source](https://eliademy.com/catalog/catalog/product/view/sku/02d7338a7e) of the [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/).
