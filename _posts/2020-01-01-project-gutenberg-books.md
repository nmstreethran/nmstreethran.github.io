This is side project that I recently started. I am compiling interesting public domain books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) into PDFs using LaTeX. I have completed the following books so far:

- [Robin Hood](https://github.com/nmstreethran/books/blob/master/books/robin-hood/robin-hood.pdf)
- [Viking Tales](https://github.com/nmstreethran/books/blob/master/viking-tales/viking-tales.pdf)
