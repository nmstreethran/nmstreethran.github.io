I have finally decided to complete [Module 5: Open Research Software and Open Source](https://eliademy.com/catalog/catalog/product/view/sku/02d7338a7e) of the [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/). 

To complete this module, one has to complete the following tasks: 

1. Set-up your first project on GitHub
2. Index your GitHub projects with Zenodo to make them citable
3. Integrate Git with RStudio for version control

I came across my undergraduate honours project while going through my files. My project was on paper-based microfluidic devices for point-of-care disease diagnostics, and I submitted it in April 2016. I then went on to specialise in renewable energy, and did not work on this project further. I thought I should release the files under open-source licenses. Who knows, they might be of interest to someone in the domain of medical devices. At the same time, I can use them to complete this module and learn a thing or two about versioning and indexing projects with Zenodo.

The files can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nmstreethran/paper-based-microfluidics). The final updated version is on Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2671872.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2671872).

The repository contains [computer-aided design (CAD) files and engineering drawings](https://github.com/nmstreethran/paper-based-microfluidics/blob/master/CAD_files) of four different design concepts of paper-based microfluidic devices, in addition to the [final report](https://github.com/nmstreethran/paper-based-microfluidics/blob/master/final_report.pdf). 

If you find this interesting, please let me know. 

P.S., I highly recommend everyone to join the [Open Science MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/)!
