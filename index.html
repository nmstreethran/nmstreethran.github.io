<p>
Hello! My name is Nithiya Streethran.
</p>

<p>
I am an early-stage researcher interested in improving energy and
environmental decisions using data science methods and open source software.
I have an academic background in mechanical engineering, with a specialisation
in renewable energy.
</p>

<p>
I am a self-taught programmer and aspiring open source software developer,
with experience using Python, LaTeX, HTML and CSS. I use Linux (Ubuntu) as
my primary operating system, and switch to Microsoft Windows occasionally
to play my favourite role-playing games â€“ The Elder Scrolls series.
I am passionate about sustainability, and I like cats, houseplants and
fantasy. I am always looking to improve my knowledge, learn new skills
and broaden my perspectives.
