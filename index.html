<p>
Hello! My name is Nithiya Streethran.
</p>

<p>
I am an early-stage researcher interested in improving decision making processes in energy systems by applying data science methods. To be more specific, I am currently focussing on applying machine learning methods to forecast renewable electricity production and optimise the dispatch of generating units in short-term electricity markets. I have an academic background in mechanical engineering, specialising in renewable energy.
</p>

<p>
I am a self-taught programmer and aspiring open source software developer, with experience using languages including Python, LaTeX, HTML and CSS. I use Linux (Ubuntu) as my primary operating system, and switch to Microsoft Windows occasionally to play my favourite role-playing games (i.e., The Elder Scrolls series üßùüåô‚≠ê). I am also passionate about sustainability, history and houseplants.
</p>

<p>
I am always looking to improve my knowledge, learn new skills and broaden my perspectives. Would you like to keep in touch with me, or perhaps collaborate, or send me some feedback? Please feel free to leave a comment below (requires a GitHub account), or contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/nmstreethran">Twitter</a>. If you would like to know more about my professional background, please view my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nmstreethran">LinkedIn</a> profile.
