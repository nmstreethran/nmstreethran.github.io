<p>
Hello! My name is Nithiya Streethran.
</p>

<p>
I am an early-stage researcher interested in improving decision making
processes in energy systems by applying data science methods. I have an
academic background in mechanical engineering, specialising in renewable
energy.
</p>

<p>
I am a self-taught programmer and aspiring open source software developer,
with experience using Python, LaTeX, HTML and CSS. I use Linux (Ubuntu) as
my primary operating system, and switch to Microsoft Windows occasionally
to play my favourite role-playing games ‚Äì The Elder Scrolls series üåô‚≠ê.
I am passionate about sustainability, and I like cats, houseplants and
fantasy. I am always looking to improve my knowledge, learn new skills
and broaden my perspectives.
