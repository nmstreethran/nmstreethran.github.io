<p>
Hello! My name is Nithiya Streethran.
</p>

<p>
I am an early-stage researcher interested in improving decision making processes in energy systems by applying data science methods. I am currently focussing on <a href="https://github.com/ENSYSTRA/short-term-forecasting">applying machine learning methods to forecast renewable electricity production and optimise the dispatch of electricity generating units in short-term markets</a>. I have an academic background in mechanical engineering, specialising in renewable energy.
</p>

<p>
I am a self-taught programmer and aspiring open source software developer, with experience using languages such as Python, LaTeX, HTML and CSS. I use Linux (Ubuntu) as my primary operating system, and switch to Microsoft Windows occasionally to play my favourite role-playing games (i.e., The Elder Scrolls series. üßùüåô‚≠ê) I am also passionate about sustainability, cats and houseplants. I also have an interest in languages and history. I am always looking to improve my knowledge, learn new skills and broaden my perspectives.
