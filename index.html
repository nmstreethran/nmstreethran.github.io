<p>
Hello! My name is Nithiya Streethran.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>TL;DR:</b> I am an early-stage researcher in sustainable energy systems, interested in open source and data science for energy and sustainability. I like houseplants, cats and The Elder Scrolls</i> 🌱🐈🧝<i>. Feel free to get in touch if you would like to talk or collaborate!</i>
</p>

<p>
I am an early-stage researcher interested in improving decision making processes in energy systems by applying data science methods. To be more specific, I am currently focussing on <a href="https://github.com/ENSYSTRA/short-term-forecasting">applying machine learning methods to forecast renewable electricity production and optimise the dispatch of electricity generating units in short-term markets</a>. I have an academic background in mechanical engineering, specialising in renewable energy.
</p>

<p>
I am a self-taught programmer and aspiring open source software developer, with experience using languages including Python, LaTeX, HTML and CSS. I use Linux (Ubuntu) as my primary operating system, and switch to Microsoft Windows occasionally to play my favourite role-playing games (i.e., The Elder Scrolls series 🌙⭐). I am also passionate about sustainability, cats and houseplants. I also have an interest in languages and history. I am always looking to improve my knowledge, learn new skills and broaden my perspectives.
